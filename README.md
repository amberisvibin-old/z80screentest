# z80screentest

This is a simple program I used to help design and test the character font I am planning on using. It's capabilities are limited to only white on black text. It will likely be updated and expanded for my design needs.

### Dependencies:

- SDL2

### To do:

- Move char array and maps to a seperate file

- Add colour

- Add a way to make custom sprites
